## webVR
As it's currently difficult to watch web VR content in full screen on iOS devices, i created this tool.
It has some hidden features ;o)

* Some gestures allow you to adjust the presentation (vertical offset and scaling).

* A long press allows you to deactivate momentarily the previous gestures and gives access to the web view content through touch events.

* You can change the current content using a remote web browser connected to your iOS device.

* The tool detects sketchfab content and activates automatically its VR view. A same mechanism exists for A-frame content but it's more experimental.
